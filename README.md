Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCEDIR, --sourcedir=SOURCEDIR
                        folder where the wsd files are stored
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Where the output should be written to

As default the current directory is assumed if no other value is invoked. If no wsd file is found, only the header will be printed.
